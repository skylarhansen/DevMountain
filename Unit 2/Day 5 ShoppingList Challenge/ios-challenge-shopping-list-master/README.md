# Instructions for ShoppingList

Shopping list is designed to help you practice using what you learned in this Unit. You will have to use UIAlertControllers, CoreData, and intermediate table view concepts, including a custom UITableViewCell and a protocol.

Please fork and clone this repository, then watch the screen recording provided before starting. This will show you what you need to build. Your project must display shopping list items in a table view with custom cells, persist shopping list items across launches using CoreData, allow the user to "swipe to delete," allow the user to add items to the list using a UIAlertController with a text field, and present an alert to the user when a task is due. Best of luck.
